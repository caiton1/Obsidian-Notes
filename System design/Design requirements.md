Often, no matter how complex a system it is usually one or more of the following:
- Move data
- Store data
- Transform data
ie. how do you move, store or transform those 0s and 1s 

What is good design?
- availability
	- uptime / (uptime + downtime)
- SLA (service level agreement)
	- SLO (service level objective)
		- measurements
			- availability (uptime)
			- reliability (probability that system wont fail)
			- fault tolerance (ability to handle faults)
			- redundancy (something that repeats or is another option that is technically unessential)
			- throughput (requests per second)
			- latency (how long it takes to respond)
